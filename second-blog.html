    <h1>This is the continued walkthrough of Node.js docs...</h1>

    <h2>Blog # 2:Currently we are learning about the built in file system called fs.</h2>
    <h2>The fs module enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.</h2>
    <h2 style="background-color: silver; padding: 7px;">The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.</h2>
    </h2>

    <h2>In order to use this module, create an app.js file in the root of this directory...</h2>
    <h2 style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px;">const fs = require(<span style="color:red;">'fs'</span>);</h2>
    <br>

    <h2>All file system operations have synchronous, callback, and promise-based forms.</h2>
    <h2>I'm doing all this with the same project that I am writing this blog in. I think that is fine...</h2>
    <h3>...I guess that's fine. We shall see.</h3>
    <h2>The only javascript I have written is that ONE line of code that says
        <h2><span style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">require(<span style="color: red;">'ls'</span>)</span> , ( require() is a built in function)...</h2>

            <h2>The first thing to do when starting a new Node.js project is to install the project's dependencies.</h2>
            <h2>Dependencies are third-party node modules used in your project modules, like express, give you a lot of power, so</h2>

            <h2>you don't have to write a complete Web application from scratch.</h2>
            <h2>to install the applications dependencies on another machine.</h2>

            <img src="images/celbrate.png">
            <h2>Let's take a look at how to start a new Node project, and install Express.</h2>
            <h2>First things first, we're using three primary applications on a local machine, a web browser, a terminal and a text editor</h2>
            <h2>I have my Terminal open in VS Code, I am on a Mac.</h2>
            <h2>...and we are on the internet so we are using a browser.</h2>
            <h2> We'll create all files that we need from scratch as we go.</h2>
            <h2>If you follow along with me, you should have the same results</h2>
            <h2>Now that we know node and npm are running, we can install express</h2>
            <h2>Open the Terminal in VS code. Just like in the first blog type</h2>
            <h2 style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px;">node -v</h2>
            <h2>then type</h2>
            <h2 style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px;">npm -v</h2>
            <h2>Now that we are sure that node and our package manager are here and working for us we can go ahead and say</h2>
            <h2>to create a directory that will hold the express application using the command</h2>
            <h2 style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px;">mkdir flashcards</h2>
            <h2>Let's call the directory flashcards, and open the directory</h2>
            <h2>by using the command cd, and then the directory name, <span style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px;">cd flashcards</span></h2>
            <h2>Now, to initialize a Node application, you can use </h2>
            <h2 style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px;">npm init -y.</h2>
            <h2>The -y just accepts all the default options... Otherwise, you'd have to type them all by hand.</h2>
            <h2>With our package.json generated, we can install and save Express.</h2>
            <h2 style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 10px;">npm install express --save</h2>
            <h2>--save adds this package to the package.json file making it super simple</h2>
            <h2>to install the applications dependencies on another machine.</h2>
            <h2>Now that we have express installed, their should be two .json packages</h2>
            <h2>and some new node modules</h2>



            <h2>Tomorrow we will start to add some code for our application.</h2>

            <h1>That's right! We've just made an express.js application with node modules and everything..</h1>
            <img src="images/good-night.png">
            <h2>And a good night to all. Tomorrow, we build!</h2>
            <h2>I hope you're excited to build this out</h2>
            <h2>Here is what you should now have to begin next blog...</h2>
            <h2></h2>
